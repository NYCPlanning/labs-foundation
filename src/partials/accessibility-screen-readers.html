Adding `display: none` to an element will prevent screen readers from reading it. There are better ways to hide content while still making it accessible to screen readers.


#### Show for Screen Readers Only

To visually hide content, while still allowing assistive technology to read it, add the `.show-for-sr` class.

```
<p class="show-for-sr">This paragraph can only be read by a screen reader.</p>
<p>There's a paragraph above this one, but you can't see it.</p>
```
<div class="callout">
<p class="show-for-sr">This paragraph can only be read by a screen reader.</p>
<p>There's a paragraph above this one, but you can't see it.</p>
</div>


#### Hide for Screen Readers Only

To hide text from assistive technology, while still keeping it visible, add the attribute `aria-hidden="true"`. This doesn't affect how the element looks, but screen readers will skip over it.

```
<p aria-hidden="true">This text can be seen, but won't be read by a screen reader.</p>
```
<div class="callout">
  <p aria-hidden="true">This text can be seen, but won't be read by a screen reader.</p>
</div>

_Note: It's usually not a good idea to hide content from screen readers, but `aria-hidden` is best used to mask purely visual elements of a page. Try to avoid purely decorative text and images._


#### Skip links

In a product with a lot of navigation, a screen reader has to read through the entire navigation to get to the content. This can be remedied by adding a skip link before the navigation, which takes the user to the main content.

The `.show-on-focus` class hides an element, except when it has focus. Adding `tabindex` to the target element makes it focusableâ€”a negative value (e.g. `tabindex="-1"`) means the element is focusable, but not reachable via sequential keyboard navigation; `tabindex="0"` means the element is focusable in sequential keyboard navigation.

```
<a class="show-on-focus" href="#main-content">Skip to content</a>
<header id="header" role="banner">
  <!-- a lot of navigation -->
</header>
<main id="main-content" role="main" tabindex="0">...</main>
```
