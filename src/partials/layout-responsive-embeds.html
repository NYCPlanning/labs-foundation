To make sure embedded content maintains its aspect ratio at various screen sizes, wrap the `iframe`, `object`, `embed`, or `video` in a container with the `.responsive-embed` class.

```
<div class="responsive-embed widescreen">
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6QJYgm0fRHk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
```
<div class="callout">
  <div class="responsive-embed widescreen">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6QJYgm0fRHk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>

#### Embedded videos

**Disable autoplay** &mdash; Specific sites like Facebook and YouTube play video automatically. When embedding video, do not enable autoplay.

**Make sure text is legible** &mdash; When displaying text in videos, make sure that it's reasonably large, uses high-contrast colours, and remains on screen for long enough to be read.

**Provide subtitles** &mdash; A lot of video is watched without sound (as much as 85 percent on Facebook). This also makes the vides accessibility for users with auditory disabilities.
