{{{headerify 'h3' 'Drop shadows'}}}
{{#markdown}}

Drop shadows are used very sparingly and subtly. Do not apply drop shadows to content elements like buttons or text. Drop shadows should only be applied to the layout's primary containers. Shadows should not have any blur, they should retain sharp edges. The color of a shadow should be `rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`, or pure black at 10 percent opacity.
